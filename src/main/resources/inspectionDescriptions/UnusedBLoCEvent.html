    Detects unused BLoC events in Dart files within Flutter projects, highlighting instances where a subclassed event is not referenced within the associated BLoC file. This inspection helps maintain clean code by identifying and prompting actions for potentially redundant event classes.
</p>
<p>
    The inspection looks for Dart classes that subclass a BLoC event but lack references in their corresponding BLoC file. If a BLoC event class is found unused, the plugin suggests adding a handler to address the issue. This inspection encourages better code organization by ensuring that BLoC event subclasses are correctly referenced, reducing unnecessary classes in the project.
