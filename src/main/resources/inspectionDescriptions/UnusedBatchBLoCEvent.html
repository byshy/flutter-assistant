    Does the same work as UnusedBLoCEvent, but it fixes the issues as a batch and not 1 by 1

<p>
    The inspection looks for Dart classes that subclass a BLoC event but lack references in their corresponding BLoC file. If a BLoC event class is found unused, the plugin suggests adding a handler to address the issue. This inspection encourages better code organization by ensuring that BLoC event subclasses are correctly referenced, reducing unnecessary classes in the project.

part of 'core_bloc.dart';

class CoreEvent extends Equatable {
  const CoreEvent();

  @override
  List&lt;Object?&gt; get props => [];
}

class CoreScreenMounted extends CoreEvent {
  const CoreScreenMounted();
}

class Test21 extends CoreEvent {} // Highlighted as unused BLoC event
